* VIS fails to start from first attempt due to the following error:
    time="2022-05-11 10:18:33.653" level=fatal msg="Can't create ws server:
        Get \"http://localhost:8800/stats\": dial tcp [::1]:8800: connect: connection refused
        [github.com/aoscloud/aos_vis/plugins/telemetryemulatoradapter.(*TelemetryEmulatorAdapter).getDataFromTelemetryEmulator:267]

    Regardless aos-vis is started after telemetry-emulator the server is not opened. We need to start aos-vis once the
    server port is open.
    Probably we don't need telemetry-emulator at all.

* Make recipes for domx.service to proper shutdown domains and remove WA in guestreboot.sh
    In meta-xt-common guest domain services uses `/usr/sbin/xl destroy DomD` on stop. It makes using reboot command on
    update dangerous because some data may no be flashed properly to the disk. It is WA'ed now in `guestreboot.sh` by
    shuting down all guest domains before issuing reboot command. The proper fix is to shutdown domain on stop of
    the corresponding service and to destroy the domain after timeout (`domd.service`):
    ```
        ExecStop=/usr/sbin/xl shutdown DomD -w
        ExecStopPost=/usr/sbin/xl destroy DomD
    ```

* CM sometimes can't be properly stopped on reboot: "stop job is running for AOS Communication Manager (26s / 1min 30s)"

* UM doesn't handle properly uboot.env file. It doesn't like 0x00 at the end. As WA fixed size is written in uboot (0x3E):
    ```
    setenv aos_save_vars 'env export -t ${loadaddr} aos_boot_main aos_boot_part aos_boot1_ok aos_boot2_ok; fatwrite mmc 0:3 ${loadaddr} uboot.env 0x3E'
    ```
